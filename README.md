Developed a web-based event booking application that allows users to browse events, register, and make bookings online. The system supports event management, booking confirmations, and database-driven record keeping. Built using C#, .NET, JavaScript, and SQL, with a focus on usability, secure data handling, and efficient system flow. This project strengthened skills in full-stack development, RESTful API integration, and real-world problem solving.
